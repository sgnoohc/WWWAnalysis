# The script does three things in serial
# 1. This script loops over the baby directory area and aggregates all the commands that need to be called to run the job.
#    The output will be stored into .jobs.txt
# 2. Then rooutil/xargs.sh will call the .jobs.txt to execute the jobs in parallel (36 cores)
# 3. Afterwards, the outputs will be hadded into background groups for easier histogramming
